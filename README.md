- 👋 Hi, I’m @Niffxd. I began my personal and professional development shortly after finishing high school, giving an Introduction to Arduino based on C language. During my time at the Universidad Tecnológica Nacional in the Information Systems Engineering career, I was able to study C/C++ and Java languages

- 🌱 Currently, I study in a self-taught way where I got various certifications, from Google to LinkedIn. Also in organizations like Henry where I learned about the PERN Stack of web development and was able to develop my soft skills as a "Teaching Assistant" where I was in charge of new entrants to the program.

- 💞️ I am a curious and skilled person to solve problems. I am constantly developing and I love challenges

- 👀 I am looking for opportunities to do internships in the IT area, where I can develop more technical knowledge and grow together with the company and my co-workers.
